Basic python scripts to download an xml file of forthcoming Scottish Government Official Statistics, and do some basic processing of the xml file. Really just a proof of concept. 

The xml service these scripts use to get the data may not be available, and may not be up to date.  

An up to date excel list of all forthcoming publications is available at: http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/ForthcomingPubs
